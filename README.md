# Adaptive_divergence_Heliconius_eyes

Analysis scripts and data for Wright et al. 2023 Adaptive divergence in the eyes of Heliconius butterflies likely contributes to pre- and post-mating isolation.

This repository contains six items:

1.	“eye_morph_selection_analyses.R” is the annotated R-scripts for all related analyses and figures. The datasets for these analyses are provided in 3-6 below.

2.	“complied R report.pdf” is the complied report of the above R analyses. 

3.	“eye_morphology_cp_mp_f1.csv” is the main dataset for the outer eye morphology of H. cydno, H. melpomene, and their reciprocal F1 hybrids.

4.	“legs.csv” is the dataset of leg vs. right hind tibia lengths from sampled butterflies. 

5.	“method_comp.csv” is a dataset of extracted values from Figure 7 in Seymoure et al. (2015) Peripheral eye dimensions in Longwing (Heliconius) butterflies vary with body size and sex but not light environment nor mimicry ring.

6.	“fst_martin2013.csv” is the dataset of Genome-wide Fst values between H. c. chioneus and H. m. rosina from Martin et al. (2013) Genome-wide evidence for speciation with gene flow in Heliconius butterflies.
